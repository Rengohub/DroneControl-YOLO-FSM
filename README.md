# DroneControl-YOLO-FSM
DroneControl-YOLO-FSM is an advanced Python-based system for real-time control and object detection using Tello drones. It leverages the YOLOv3 model for efficient and accurate object detection, integrating this with a Finite State Machine (FSM) for responsive and dynamic drone control.
